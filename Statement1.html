        <h1>statement</h1>
        <p>
          When we were given the theme "unseen" the first thing that came to my
          mind was invisible, something no one can see just like our thoughts.
          Through this assignment I tried to represent a part of my thought
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we cannot see what a person is thinking we need to communicate
          to understand what is going on their mind. On my second page
          <a href="sit.html">SIT</a>.I showed someone asking what is on their
          mind. When you proceed into the thought bubble which seems to be
          blank, leads to <a href="bubblemind.html">bubbleMind</a>. That page is
          a representation of my mind. A busy mind, a mind that wonders a lot.
          And it gets hard at times to be present. I relate my thoughts as
          bubbles. When there’s many bubbles and you try to touch one, it
          disappears, just like my thoughts. When ever I try to engage with my
          thoughts, I jump to another one and most of the time can not remember
          what I was even thinking. So, when I am asked what is on my mind it’s
          hard to explain so I have put a tear drop on that page that leads to
          negative self talk. Most of the harm that is caused in our head, is by
          us and our thoughts. On <a href="thoughts.html">THOUGHTS</a> I tried
          to show self-critical version of my mind. I can be thinking everything
          and nothing at the same time, which is often overwhelming. I was once
          told that if I want to feed my problem I can keep thinking about it
          but if I want to starve the problem I need to take action.<a
            href="walk.html"
            >WALK</a
          >
          is the first action that I take to get away from my own overwhelming
          thoughts. Thoughts that are unseen but can be disturbing at times. I
          go for a walk for fresh air and try to remind myself that it’s okay to
          feel that way. On that page there’s heart on one of the building, that
          is my happy place. It is the place with the people who are patient
          with me and tries to understand the unseen with me.
